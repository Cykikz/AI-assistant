AI Assistant Project
This project is a voice-based AI Assistant that can respond to commands such as searching Wikipedia, fetching weather information, answering questions via OpenAI's GPT, and more.

Features
Text-to-Speech: Converts responses into speech.
Speech Recognition: Listens to voice commands.
Wikipedia Search: Fetches summaries from Wikipedia.
Weather Information: Provides real-time weather updates.
GPT-3 Chat: Answers queries using OpenAI's GPT.
Modular Commands: Easily extendable for additional features.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.
API keys:
OpenAI API Key: Sign up here.
OpenWeatherMap API Key: Get it here.
1.Installation
Clone the repository or save the script file.

2.Create a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv ai_assistant_env
source ai_assistant_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ai_assistant_env\Scripts\activate

3.Install required libraries:
pip install pyttsx3
pip install speechrecognition
pip install pywhatkit
pip install wikipedia
pip install requests
pip install openai
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
pip install pillow
pip install pytesseract

Usage
Update the openai.api_key and weather_api_key in the script with your actual API keys.
Interact with the assistant by giving commands like:

"Hello"
"Weather London"
"Wikipedia Python"
"Chat Who is the Finance Minister of India?"
"Exit" to stop the assistant.
